## My name is Jonathon Gruener
### Although I usually go by Jon

I am currently a Master's student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am studying Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. I have held internships at L3Harris, Viasat, and NIST. I am highly skilled in several programming languages, mainly Python and C++. For more information on my professional experience, please visit my LinkedIn.

In my free time, I love to play video games and lacrosse. I am on the club lacrosse team at CU Boulder and was the President of the club and a captain.
